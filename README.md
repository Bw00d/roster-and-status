# Public Information Officer Roster and Status

## Summary
This is an application for tracking the status of public information officers assigned to Incident Management Teams. It is currently specific to Information Command staff but could be expanded to be used by any Section of and incident management organization. 

## Features
Users can create teams and assign lead, assistent, and trainee public information officers. Rosters can be added to teams and users assigned to rosters.

User can create blurbs to save and share messaging and assign them hashtags so they are searchable by context and so that they can be shared with other users.

Users can create profiles and set their availability status so that Lead information officers who are looking for help can see who is available and make contact.

## Todo
This app is obviously bare bones and needs quite a bit of work but it is functional.

I will be improving the functionality and branding in the coming weeks. I will also be testing it on an incident and may discover bugs and opportunities for improvement.

- Flesh out home page: branding, logo, etc.
- Make style consitent across pages
- Set up some form of pagination for blurbs and users
- Make tag cloud stationary so that scrolling does not hide them
- Add some sort of public feed
- Make footer Sticky
